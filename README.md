# Strongly-Connected-Components

This is the prompt provided for this programming assignment in class:
Design an interface for the user to provide information about nodes and edges for a directed graph; run SCC algorithm on the graph and output all strongly connected components.


This is how the program is ran: 
First, the program asks the user for the number of verticies and edges. Then, the user inputs the verticies of each edge. With this information, it outputs the Adjacency Matrix and the Adjacency List, along with all of the Tracking Tables, which store the values of Vertex, Color, Predecessor, First-Time, and Last-Time. Lastly, it outputs all of the SCCs, or Strongly-Connected Components.
